conjugate pair
  candidate X exists in exactly two cells in a house
  other candidates can be in those cells

bivalue cell
  a cell has exactly two candidates

weak link
  two cells with candidate X share a house with other cells that have candidate X
  two candidates in a cell share that cell with other candidates
  if one is true, the others are false

strong link
  conjugate pair or bivalue cell
  if one is false, the other is true

AB switch
  candidate X in a block exists in exactly one column AND exactly one row
  if a candidate in one axis is false, one in the opposite axis must be true

AIC
  chain of even number of cells where the links start strong
  alternate weak, strong, etc
  must end with a strong link

AIC propagation rules
  1) if a cell has two weak links,
     that cell must be a bivalue cell
     the links must be pointing at each candidate
  2) if a cell has two strong links,
     they must be pointing to two different candidates in that cell
  3) if a cell has a strong and a weak link,
     both links must be pointing at the same candidate

-----------------------------------------

naked single
  *scan for cells with only one candidate
  single candidate is left in a cell

hidden single
  *scan each candidate for a single highlighted cell in a house
  a house contains only once cell with a certain candidate
  other candidates can be in that cell

naked group
  *scan each candidate for pairs and triples
  N candidates exist in N cells in a house
  no other candidates exist in those cells
  those candidates can be removed from other cells in the house

hidden group
  *scan each candidate for conjugate pair
  *test each other candidate in those two cells to see if they exist outside those cells
  N candidates exist in N cells in a house
  those candidates do not exist in any other cells
  other candidates can be in those cells
  the other candidates in those cells can be removed

pointing locked candidate
  *scan each candidate for blocks that are close to empty
  in a block, candidate X exists in only one row
  other cells in that row, candidate X can be removed
  
claiming locked candidate
  *scan each candidate for rows or columns that are close to empty
  in a row or column, candidate X exists in only one block
  other cells in that block, candidate X can be removed

x-wing
  *scan each candidate for conjugate pairs
  two sets of conjugate pairs in two rows or columns form a box
  other instances of candidate X are in the opposite axis to the conjugate pairs
  the other instances in the opposite axis can be removed
finned x-wing
  x-wing but one corner of the box has an additional candidate cell the same block
  additional candidate must be in line with the conjugate pair
  other instances can be removed from the opposite axis ONLY in the block with the fin
swordfish
  x-wing but 3 rows and columns instead of 2

turbot fish
  *scan each candidate for conjugate pairs
  two conjugate pairs of candidate X are connected with a weak link
  any candidate X that sees both ends of the chain can be removed
2 string kite
  turbot fish but one end of the chain lies in a column and the other one lies in a row
skyscraper
  turbot fish but both of the conjugate pairs are vertical or horizontal

empty rectangle
  *scan each candidate for a conjugate pair
  one end of the pair lines up with one axis of an AB switch
  a cell that sees the other end of the pair AND the other axis of the AB switch can be removed

BUG+1
  *scan all incomplete cells for a single trivalue cell
  only bivalue cells are left in the puzzle except one trivalue cell
  two of the three candidates appear twice in any house
  the last candidate appears three times in any house
  the value for the trivalue cell is the candidate that appears three times

simple coloring
  *scan for a candidate X with many conjugate pairs
  make a graph where each cell of a pair is a different color
  any candidate X that can see both colors can be removed
  if two cells of one color can see each other
    every cell with that color must be false
    every cell of the opposite color must the value X

continuous loop
  AIC where the endpoints are weakly linked to eachother
  all weak links in the chain form a strongly linked pair
  all other candidates in the house or cell can be removed

w wing
  *scan for two matching bivalue cells X and Y
  scan up/down and left/right to find a conjugate pair of X in a row or column
  if the conjugate pair of cells lines up with the bivalue cells
    you can remove candidate Y from any cells that see the two bivalue cells

slot machine
  *scan for a digit which is given or solved three times, once in each vertical and horizontal chute
  *  where one is in each row and each column
  pick a candidate in one of the boxes with two possible candidates, assume that is true
  follow the logic around to see if there is an inconsistency (highlight green)
  if so, that original candidate must be false
  if there is no inconsistency, try again with the other digit (highlight blue)
  if again there is no inconsistency
    any candidate that can see green and blue can be eliminated
  these chains can trigger other numbers, each number can be colored differently to find inconsistencies
